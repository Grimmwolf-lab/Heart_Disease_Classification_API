  - chest pain type (4 values)/cp: 0 (other valid values 0,1,2)
  - resting blood pressure/ trestbps: 145
  - serum cholestoral in mg/dl / chol: 307
  - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl / fbs: 0 (0-false, 1-true)
  - resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)/ restecg: 0
  - maximum heart rate achieved/ thalach:146
  - exercise induced angina/ exang: 1 (1-true, 0-false)
  - oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: 1
  - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment/ slope: 1
  - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy/ ca: 0 (other valid values 0 to 3)
  - thal: 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect: 3
